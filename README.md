## How to Set It Up 

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (use v3.10, idk abt other versions)
- pip (try updating to the latest)
- Ngrok (we use it for exposing your local server to the internet)

### Installation

#### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ABHAY-100/faux-detector.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd faux-detector/backend
    ```

3. **Download the `.h5` file from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0zh88gmiw79j6wozdzhxe/cnn_model.h5?rlkey=oh0g202fnkssq0r1imlz0u4s3&st=aahgdn49&dl=0) and put it in `backend folder`**:

4. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Run the Flask Application**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    *Note: Now your Flask backend will now be running on port `8000`*

#### Expose Your Backend with Ngrok

1. **Install Ngrok**:

    If you haven't already installed Ngrok, download it from [Ngrok's official website](https://ngrok.com/download) and set it up.

2. **Start Ngrok**:

    Open a new command prompt or terminal window and run the following command:

      ```bash
      ngrok http 8000
      ```

3. **Get Your Ngrok HTTPS URL**:

    After running the command, Ngrok will provide you with a public HTTPS URL that looks something like this: `https://6eba-49-37-227-89.ngrok-free.app`


#### Chrome Extension Setup

1. **Prepare Your Extension Folder**:

    Ensure your Chrome extension files are ready in a folder containing `manifest.json`, JavaScript files, and any other necessary resources.

2. **Update `manifest.json`**:

    Open your `manifest.json` file and update the `host_permissions` to include your Ngrok URL:

      ```bash
      "host_permissions": [
        "https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/*"
      ]
      ```
    *Make sure to replace `<your-ngrok-subdomain>` with the actual subdomain provided by Ngrok when you start it.*

3. **Update `content.js`**:

    Modify your `content.js` file to point to your Ngrok URL for API requests:

    ```bash
    // Send the POST request to the server
    const response = await fetch('https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/classify', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    });
    ```

4. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**:

    Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

5. **Enable Developer Mode**:

    In the top right corner of the extensions page, toggle the **Developer mode** switch to **ON**.

6. **Load Unpacked Extension**:

    - Click on the **Load unpacked** button.
    - Select the folder containing your extension files.

### Final Steps

Now ensure the extension is active; you will see a popup button over each image on your current website. Just click on the "Detect Deepfake" button, and you can see the results!
